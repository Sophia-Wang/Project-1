What is my project about?
I used 'CO' as an example to figure out how to plot the electron density as a 'fog' rather with isosurfaces. I also plot the atomic geometry in it to see the electron cloud around the atom positions.

How to use your code?
To use my code, the centered position, CHG or CHGCAR file should be get.

The steps are as follows:
1 Calculate the centered position of atom or molecule by DFT.
Through DFT calculation, get the CHG and CHGCAR file of the centered atom or molecule.   CHG and CHGCAR include a grid of electron density values and the value of NGX, NGY, NGZ.
2 Then, open a new file and input the the position of centered atom or molecule and plot the atom or molecule by using 'mlab.points3d'.
3 Plot the bond between the atoms by using 'mlab.plot3d'.
4 Input the electron density data from CHG or CHGCAR file (I used CHG file). Read lines of electron density data. Form a new 3-D array which is the same dimension as that of electron density grid in CHG or CHGCAR.
5 Visualize volumetric scalar data of electron density. As 'data.shape' probably transposes the 'data' array. So use the 'data.T' to visualize the electron density.
6 Get the final electron density figure.
