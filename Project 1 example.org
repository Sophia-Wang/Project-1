In my project, I used 'CO' as an example to figure out how to plot the electron density as a 'fog' rather with isosurfaces. I also plot the atomic geometry in it to see the electron cloud around the atom positions.
The steps are as follows:
1 Calculate the centered position CO by DFT(shown in CO-centered.org).I used atoms.center() to get the centered position of C and O. And through calc.get_charge_density(), I also get the GHG and CHGCAR file. The (NGX, NGY, NGZ) is (96,96,96) and the electron density data begin from the 12 line.
2 Open a new script and input the  position of centered CO molecule and plot the  molecule by using 'mlab.points3d'.
3 Plot the bond between the atom C and O by using 'mlab.plot3d'.
4 Input the electron density data from CHG or CHGCAR(I used CHG file). The CHG and CHGCAR are in the molecules/co-centered file which is generated from the calculation of the first step. Read lines of electron density data of CO. Form a new 3-D array with dimension of (96,96,96), which is the same dimension as that of electron density grid in CHG or CHGCAR.
5 Visualize volumetric scalar data of electron density by using mlab.pipeline.scalar_field.  As 'data.shape' probably transposes the 'data' array. So use the 'data.T' to visualize the electron density. Get min and max in data. Set the Vmin and Vmax.
6 Get the final electron density figure.
